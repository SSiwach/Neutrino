    <h1>
      Being known as "Ghost Particle", Neutrinos rarely intract with matter. They have very low masses like the feather's in Particle Physics 'Standard Model'. Physicsts for many decades think that they are massless but the recent work in this field show that neutrino have some non zero mass which help them to osciallate from one flavour to another.
